I need to check out the [fabulous](https://jart.github.io/fabulous/) library:

> Fabulous is a Python library (and command line tools) designed to make the output of terminal applications look fabulous. Fabulous allows you to print colors, images, and stylized text to the console (without curses.) Fabulous also offers features to improve the usability of Pythonâ€™s standard logging system.

`byproject.py` usage examples where we have made an alias:

    alias bp='~/Documents/Projects/todo/byproject.py'

Examples:

    # Show contents of todo.txt by project
    bp
    # Show items in todo.txt with project tags "proposals" and "whitepapers"
    bp -i proposals whitepapers
    # Show items in todo.txt except for those with project tag "personal" and "home"
    bp -x personal home
    # Show items for today in done.txt
    bp -p 0
    # Show items for last 3 days in done.txt
    bp -p 3
    # Show items for last week in temp.txt
    bp -p 7 -f temp.txt
    # Show items for last week in done.txt with project tag "make3dprinter"
    bp -p 7 -i make3dprinter
    # Show items for last week in temp.txt with project tag "make3dprinter"
    bp -p 7 -i make3dprinter -f temp.txt
    # Show items for last week in done.txt except for those with project tag "groceries"
    bp -p 7 -x groceries
    # Show all items in done.txt
    bp -a
    # Show items for specified day in done.txt
    bp -d YYYY-MM-DD
    # Show items for week starting on specified day in done.txt
    bp -w YYYY-MM-DD
    # Show items for month in done.txt
    bp -m YYYY-MM
    # Show items in specified date range in done.txt
    bp -r YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD
    # Show items in specified date range in done.txt with project tag "make3dprinter"
    bp -r YYYY-MM-DD YYYY-MM-DD -i make3dprinter

## Implement -i and -x options

I need to implement the -i and -x options (see below under Saturday, 2016-09-03). With these options there are 3 possibilities:

1. Get all projects. This is currently what is implemented
2. Include only specified projects (-i flag)
3. Include all projects except specified projects (-x flag)

Item 1:

    if project not in jobs:
        jobs[project] = []
    jobs[project].append(line)

Item 2:

    if project in include_list:
        if project not in jobs:
            jobs[project] = []
        jobs[project].append(line)

Item 3:

    if project not in exclude_list:
        if project not in jobs:
            jobs[project] = []
        jobs[project].append(line)

So I need to make a function, `add_line` that does

    if project not in jobs:
        jobs[project] = []
    jobs[project].append(line)

and then I can structure the logic like this:

    if args.include != None:
        if project in args.include:
            add_line()
    elif args.exclude != None:
        if project not in args.exclude:
            add_line()
    else
        add_line()

### Status: DONE!

## More

- &#9989; Add -v --verbose flag to control what information is printed when byproject.py is run
- &#9989; Make printed output nicer & compatible with markdown
    - Example: `bp -p 7 > temp.md` puts output in `temp.md`, which looks nice when rendered
- &#9989; Make file executable
- &#9989; Move directory to ~/Documents/Projects/todo
- &#9989; Add alias to .bash_profile

# Saturday, 2016-09-03

Here is an alternate way of doing things:

    #----------------------------------------------------
    # Only one of these can be specified at a time
    #----------------------------------------------------
    # DONE: current items in todo.txt
    ./byproject.py
    # DONE: previous N days from today in done.txt
    ./byproject.py -p N
    # DONE: specific day in done.txt
    ./byproject.py -d 2016-08-21
    # DONE: all days in a week starting at specified date in done.txt
    ./byproject.py -w 2016-08-21
    # DONE: all days in a specified month in done.txt
    ./byproject.py -m 2016-08
    # DONE: all days in a specified date range in done.txt
    ./byproject.py -r 2016-08-07 2016-08-14
    # DONE: all days in done.txt
    ./byproject.py -a
    #----------------------------------------------------
    # These can be mixed with the above
    #----------------------------------------------------
    # DONE: Specify a different input file
    ./byproject.py -f filename
    # NOT IMPLEMENTED-OUTPUT IS ALREADY INDENTED IN MARKDOWN COMPATIBLE WAY Create output in markdown format
    ./byproject.py --markdown
    # DONE: Include only the following projects
    ./byproject.py -i project1 project2 ...
    # DONE: Exclude the following projects
    ./byproject.py -x project1 project2 ...

Other items

- &#9989; Fix problem when specified date isn't present in file go to next nearest date after specified date.
- I also need to improve the visual formatting of the results (?)
- Perhaps change t xp 3 to show results by week, month, date range, etc. like above, as well as having the current behavior (?)
- Make the code a module too so can import it into other python scripts
- Check that done.txt is sorted by completion date (descending)

More ideas

- Heirarchy of todo files
    - todo.txt - immediate, today
    - soon.txt - needs done in the next days or week; review each morning
    - someday.txt - possibly do in the future
    - done.txt - finished items
    - notdone.txt - items that made it on the todo list but then were dropped off
- Only show todo's with priorities
- Have a secondary list?

### Final status today

I need to change `get_start_and_end_dates_indices(lines, startdate, enddate)` to handle corner cases

# Sunday, 2016-08-14

**<font color=red>Note: if the terminal window gets messed up, execute `tset` to reset it to default values</font>**

## Try curses for color output

### Resources

- [Python Curses - Johns Cool Things](https://www.ironalbatross.net/wiki/index.php?title=Python_Curses)
- [Curses Programming with Python - docs.python.org](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html#curses-howto)

### Conclusion

Curses is overkill for what I need. It wants you to clear the screen, write stuff to arbitrary positions on the screen, and when it's done clear the screen again. Go back to trying to use escape codes.

## Try escape codes with regular `print()` function - (use colorama)

### Resources

- [Print colored text in terminal](https://pythonadventures.wordpress.com/2011/03/16/print-colored-text-in-terminal/)
    - Nice shortcut by defining `colorred = "\033[01;31m{0}\033[00m"` and then using `print(colorred.format("Test red text..."))`
- [colorama](https://github.com/tartley/colorama) python package
    - Makes escape codes work on Windows as well as *nix OS's. Also provides shortcuts for escape codes (like `Fore.RED`).
    - This seems to be installed with anaconda python 3.5
- [blessings](https://github.com/erikrose/blessings) - A thin, practical wrapper around terminal capabilities in Python
    - I tried to conda install this package into anaconda python 3.5, but apparently there is some dependency conflict

### Conclusion

Use the colorama package since it is already installed with Anaconda. Make usage more concise with

    red = Fore.RED + '{0}' + Style.RESET_ALL
    print(red.format("This is red text."))

instead of

    print(Fore.RED + 'This is red text.' + Style.RESET_ALL)

## Be able to also use `done.txt` through command line arguments

Now I want to show the same sort of output except for `done.txt`, and I want to restrict how many days back results are shown.

Example usage:

    # Use todo.txt as default
    ./print_todo3.py
    # -d or --done for today through previous 3 days
    ./print_todo3.py -d 3
    # just today
    ./print_todo3.py -d 0

Ultimately, I would also like to do the following (which will require quite a bit of hacking with maybe a different solution than argparse):

    # all days in done.txt
    ./print_todo3.py -d all
    # all days in a specified month
    ./print_todo3.py -d 2016-08
    # all days in a specified date range
    ./print_todo3.py -d 2016-08-07 to 2016-08-14

After reading through the second resource below, I think it could be done like so:

    parser.add_argument('--done', '-d',
                        action='store_true',
                        help='use done.txt instead of todo.txt' )
    parser.add_argument('args', nargs=argparse.REMAINDER)
    args = parser.parse_args()
    if args.done:
        filename = 'done.txt'
        # check if args.args is empty -> print only today
        # If it's a single integer include today back through that number of days
        # If it's a month date (2016-08), print that month
        # If it's a day date (2016-08-11), print that day
        # If it's two day dates (2016-08-14 and 2016-08-16), figure out
        #    which is the earlier and set it as the start date and the other
        #    as the end date and print between those dates

I could also add the capability to include only specified projects, or leave out specified projects.

## How handle reading only certain dates in done.txt?

Can we assume that all of the items completed on a certain date are in a contiguous block, and that these blocks are consecutively date ordered? Yes, although it would probably be good to make a `sort_done.py` script to enforce this.

- How read first date in a line?
- How determine today's date?
- How compare dates?
- How specify a date range?

- [Stack Overflow: Extracting date from a string in Python](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3276180/extracting-date-from-a-string-in-python)

## Status

- `./print_todo4.py -d 5` will read all items from `done.txt` from 5 days ago to the present and print them organized by project
- `./print_todo4.py` will read all items from `todo.txt` and print them organized by project

# Saturday, 2016-08-13

## Objective

Make a `.py` file to develop a script to print todo.txt lines to the terminal in the following format:

- project1
    - item1 (earliest date)
    - item2 (next earliest date)
    - etc.
- project2
    - item1 (earliest date)
    - item2 (next earliest date)
    - etc.

If an item has a priority, don't change ordering, but do change its color [(Add Colour to Text in Python](http://ozzmaker.com/add-colour-to-text-in-python/), [Python colored output)](http://www.siafoo.net/snippet/88):

- \(A) = Red
- \(B) = Blue
- \(C) = Green
- anything else: lime green

Later, do the same for `done.txt` except specify optional argument specifying how many days back to include. Then be able to print from `done.txt` in the following format so I can look at what I got done on each day:

- date1
    - project1
        - item1
        - item2
        - etc.
    - project2
        - item1
        - item2
        - etc.
- date2
    - project1
        - item1
        - item2
        - etc.
    - project2
        - item1
        - item2
        - etc.

## Starting point

Stack Overflow question: [Sorting todo.txt lines by its properties](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30501609/sorting-todo-txt-lines-by-its-properties)

## Make `.py` file executable

According to Rose Perrone's answer at [Stack Overflow (Why do people write #!/usr/bin/env python on the first line of a Python script?)](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2429511/why-do-people-write-usr-bin-env-python-on-the-first-line-of-a-python-script?rq=1) put

    #!/usr/bin/env python3.5

as the first line in the script. Then at the command line execute

    chmod +x print_todo1.py

to make the file executable so it can be run as

    ./print_todo1.py

from the terminal (command line).
